This app is live at: [Theme Switcher](https://bilalmuhammad41.github.io/theme_switcher/)

## Overview

This is a basic Theme Switcher I built to gain a better understanding of React's Context API and to create a practical application for switching between light and dark themes.

### Features

- **Theme Switching:** The primary feature of this project is the ability to toggle between light and dark themes, allowing users to choose the visual style that suits them best.

### Technologies Used

- **React:** I used React to build the core functionality of the theme switcher, taking advantage of React's powerful state management capabilities.

- **Vite:** I initialized the project using Vite, a build tool for web development. It allowed me to quickly set up the project and streamline the development process.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS was used for styling the project, making it responsive and visually appealing.

### Acknowledgement

- I followed the React context API crash course by [Chai or Code](https://www.youtube.com/@chaiaurcode) on YouTube.
